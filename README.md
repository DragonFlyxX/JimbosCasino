A Balatro mod that places further focus on econ jokers; because, who doesn't love money?

Features:
- 15 custom Jokers

Art / Programming was done solely by me, and although I had fun getting these jokers to work, I NEVER want to touch lua code again.
- I'm not planning to monitor bug fixes too closely, but I'll try my best to access major bugs or issues.
- If The mod isn't loading correctly then removing the "-main" from the mod folder may fix the issue.
